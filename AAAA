//                     <p>My field is designing, programming and producing clean, creative and fully interactive websites.<br />You can approach me with just a simple idea of a website, and together we'll come up with a design, layout and content suitable for your specific needs.
                    Otherwise, if you already have the design or an idea on how you want your website to look, contact me with that information and I'll simply develop it right away.</p><hr><p>
                    My job is helping people and companies grow their businnes through web development. This means that my goal won't just be to produce a beautiful and well functioning website for you, it will be to create a website that strengthens your companyâ€™s brand while ensuring ease of use and simplicity for your audience. That is what you're paying me for; to help grow your businnes - through web development.</p><hr>
                    <p>Finding and trusting someone to do your work is hard. You can go all over the internet and find someone who could do the work for you in just a couple of days for a cheap price, but the quality will suffer, deeply. And that is the most important aspect of a website, it's quality. As I student, I do most of my work for a cheap price, in return for experience.  </p>
